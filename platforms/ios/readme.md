We built an iOS version of the BitShares Wallet, but Apple denied it. <br>
We submitted Appeal after Appeal daily for over a month. <br>
Apparently, Apple does not want too many cryptocurrency products in their App Store anymore. <br><br>

So, if you have a jailbreak'd iPhone then feel free to compile this wallet or do with it as you please. <br>
Somewhere in the app please give attribution to BitShares Munich but feel free to modify the app anyway you see fit :)
